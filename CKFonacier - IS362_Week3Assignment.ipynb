    "On a bicycle trip from New York, NY to Key West, FL, a cyclist travels a certain amount of miles and then records the travel distance traveled each day based on the odometer reading. The travel distance between the two cities is at least 1,533 miles in total (according to optimal cycling route provided by Google Maps, ignoring the ferry ride). The cyclist dutifully logs the odometer reading at the end of each day to record the amount of distance traveled. Furthermore, they plan to record the cumulative amount of distance they travel for the entirety of the trip, until they reach Key West.\n",

    "Any travels less than 100 miles indicates sightseeing at the current location, taking a rest stop to enjoy the attractions. Sometimes it may also indicate a relaxation day, traveling a shorter distance that day with more rest stops along the way before the day is finished, to avoid overexerting theirself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the entire distance traveled will not accurately reflect the route provided by Google Maps, due to having to find alternative routes to account for scenarios such as road closures, ignoring the ferry ride suggestion, taking detours to nearby cities / rest stops, etc."
